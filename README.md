**3. Comparative study with similar events**
  To support and prove the argument about the key event, this study is extended to analyze similar past events in the same ecosystem but without the support from the digital medium. 

***i. 2017 Farmers protest***
  The 2017 Farmers Protest in the capital of India was a protest against the Government by farmers from Southern region of the country, Tamil Nadu demanding waiver of their farm loans among other demands due to crop failures. The protests started after the 2016–2017 drought, which was caused after a worst rainfall in 140 years. This led to many farmers committing suicides and dying of heart attacks. The protest was started by a group of farmers in Delhi and went on for months since 14- Mar-2017 to 26-Oct-2017. The protesting farmers shaved half of their moustaches and heads, held snakes and mice in their mouths, performed mock funerals, flogged themselves, brought the skulls of other farmers who had committed suicide, drank their lateritious sediment, and even consumed human feces as protest.
  
***ii. Role of digital public sphere:*** 
  2017 farmer’s protests is one way similar to the 2020 farm law protest in terms of the availability of digital platforms. All recent days social and digital platforms were very much present in 2017. The medium of discussion and protest was limited only to the physical protest site in the capital. Digital public sphere and the social media platforms were minimally or less used for creating awareness among the public to initiate debate and put pressure on the government. Analysis of twitter data revealed that there are celebrities from India joined the protest physically but the support on digital medium was negligible and it failed to gain the momentum and pressurize government.

***iii. Tweeter Analysis: *** 
  There were 2 hashtags used during the protest to support the protesting farmers. They are #farmersprotest and #save_Farmers. During the 7 months of the protest #farmersprotest had 1737 tweets and #Save_Farmers had just 94 tweets exceedingly less to Farmers protest 2020 which had 500 thousand tweets in 15 months in just one hashtag #farmersprotest. This data clearly shows that the 2017 farmers protesters have either not used the digital platforms or there is no support in the digital platforms. 
  
***iv. Results: ***
  At the end the 7 months long protest, the outcome was less favorable to the farmers. Protesting farmers getting support from celebrities with their physical presence in the protest location and creating public debate and awareness about farmer’s very low income were undisputable. Analysis of twitter data reveals that the advantage of digital public sphere was not properly exploited to gain the required support to put pressure on the government.

**Result:**
“There is a wealth of information and diverse voices to be found online” as quoted by Schäfer, there are several upsides and downsides to be noted from the analysis. From the research, it can be observed that “Digital”, “Virtual”, or “online” public sphere provides medium of free speech which facilitates participation in government and reducing the gap in public discourse. It expands the access to government information by strengthening civil society through the building of networks among individuals. Although Internet is not a conventional mass medium it enabled communication in several ways to gain support for the farmers globally.
 
The twitter influencer’s intervention pulled the whole world’s attention to the issue by enabling and empowering the protesting farmers in persuading the government to repeal the laws. The spike in the number of tweets in Feb’22 and the 1.2 million twitter responses are the key evidence to the success of digital public sphere in empowering the farmers to make their voice heard.
